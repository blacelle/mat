				This tutorial provides a "jumping-off place" to get
				familiar with Memory Analyzer.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Open a sample heap dump</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				If you run a standalone version of Memory Analyzer you
				already have the perspective settings, otherwise you
				should switch to the Memory Analysis Perspective:

				<img src="../mimes/me76fc4.png" />
				<a href="javascript:executeCommand(&quot;org.eclipse.ui.perspectives.showPerspective(org.eclipse.ui.perspectives.showPerspective.perspectiveId=org.eclipse.mat.ui.perspective)&quot;)">
					Window &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Other... &gt; Memory Analysis						
				</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				This will activate relevant to memory analysis views,
				menus and actions.
			</p>

			<p> Open a sample heap dump using the action link:
				<img src="../mimes/me76fc4.png" />
				<a href="javascript:liveAction(&quot;org.eclipse.mat.ui&quot;,&quot;org.eclipse.mat.ui.snapshot.actions.OpenSampleHeapDumpAction&quot;,&quot;org.eclipse.mat.ui.help/heapdump/HeapDumpSample.hprof&quot;)">
					Open Sample Heap Dump </a>. Or using the File Menu:</p>

			<p>
				From the menu bar, select
				<span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">File</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol"><img src="../mimes/i-openhd.png" /> Open Heap Dump...</span></span>
				and provide the location of the heap dump in the dialog:
			</p>

				<img src="../mimes/m30bbc130.png" />
			<p><strong>Walk-through Memory Analysis Perspective</strong></p>

			<p>
				Now you have a sample heap dump opened in the Memory
				Analysis Perspective
			</p>

			<img src="../mimes/6744cf51.png" />
			<p>
				Heap dump is opened in the editor area. All new result
				views for heap dump will open as new tabs within this
				editor, next to the Overview pane.
			</p>

			<p>
				Under
				<span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Show View</span></span>
				you find all memory analysis views. By default the
				Inspector, Navigator and Notes views are visible. But you can open
				and re-arrange additional views in the memory analysis
				perspective as in any other Eclipse perspective.
			</p>

			<img src="../mimes/open_views.png" />
			<p>
				Heap Dump History View - Contains the list of heap dumps
				recently opened and supports context actions to manage
				the history.
			</p>

			<img src="../mimes/ma79a80.png" />
			<p>
				Inspector View - Provides details about the selected
				object and supports various context actions.
			</p>

			<p>
				<img src="../mimes/m2e8a36f1.png" />
			</p>

			<p> Navigation History View - Keeps history of all the opened result views and
				allows to navigate among them.
		    </p>

			<p>
				<img src="../mimes/navigator_view.png" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Notes View - You can take notes for every heap dump. The
				notes are saved together with the heap dump.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Major Heap Editors</strong>
			</p>

			<p id="N10001__class_histogram"><a name="N10001__class_histogram"><!-- --></a>
				<strong>Histogram Heap Editor</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				The heap editor Histogram lists the classes found in the
				snapshot, the number of objects for each class, the heap
				memory consumption of these objects, and optional the
				minimum retained size of the objects. You can activate
				the calculation of the retained size using the context
				menu – for the selected entry, or a toolbar action – for
				the whole histogram.
			</p>

			<img src="../mimes/m38121718.jpg" />
			<p id="N10001__histogram_by_classloader"><a name="N10001__histogram_by_classloader"><!-- --></a>
				To switch between the Class and Class Loader histogram,
				choose button:
				<img src="../mimes/i-grouping.png" />
			</p>

			<img src="../mimes/5ea1779a.jpg" />
			<p>
				The class loader view and class view display the same
				information with different grouping. In the class loader
				view the classes are grouped by the class loaders that
				load and define the various classes.
			</p>

			<p>
				The retained size of a class loader is the amount of
				memory that is collected by the garbage collector (GC)
				when all objects of the classes in the class loader are
				no longer accessible by the GC.
			</p>

			<p>
				You can filter the class or class loader histogram with a
				regular search expression in the first line of the histogram.				
			</p>
			
			<img src="../mimes/filter.png" />			
			<p>
				Context menus offer additional functionality in every
				view. For some objects you can examine the content, like
				for
				<var class="varname">HashMap</var>
				you can examine the keys/values of the data structure.
			</p>

			<p id="N10001__compare"><a name="N10001__compare"><!-- --></a>
				Button:
				<img src="../mimes/i-compare.png" />
				(Baseline) perform the comparison of two snapshots
			</p>

			<div class="p">
				<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
					Note: The percentages displayed, refer to the
					overall difference not for each class.

			<p id="N10001__dominator"><a name="N10001__dominator"><!-- --></a>
				<strong>Dominator Tree Heap Editor</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				The Dominator Tree view is used for the memory footprint
				analysis,. It is based on the same semantics as the
				retained set/size calculation. The Dominator Tree view
				represents:
			</p>

			<br /><ul>
				<li>
					The dominated objects
					<p>
						A particular object, other objects depend on and
						are garbage collected if the particular object
						can not be accessed anymore.
					</p>

				</li>

				<li>
					The dominator chain of the objects to the root
					<p>
						Which objects prohibit the garbage collection of
						a the particular object.
					</p>

				</li>

			</ul>

			<p>
				To open a Dominator Tree view, choose the button:
				<img src="../mimes/i-dominatortree.png" />
			</p>

			<img src="../mimes/29f9f92f.jpg" />
			<p>
				In the screenshot shown above, the biggest objects in
				the heap are displayed on the first tree level. Objects
				that are solely held by themselves are displayed on the
				next level and so on. If there are several objects
				referencing to a chain, only the root object of the
				chain is displayed on the first level. The other objects
				can be viewed by expanding the node.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Dominator Tree Grouping</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				The Dominator Tree can be grouped by classes,
				classloaders or packages. If there is not one huge
				object in the Dominator Tree, grouping helps to identify
				classes, classloaders or packages that occupy a lot of
				memory.

				<strong>Paths to GC Roots Heap Editor</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				The Paths to GC Roots analyzes which objects keep a
				single object in the heap. You can open this view using
				context menu
				<span class="cmdname">Path to GC Roots</span>
				.
			</p>

			<img src="../mimes/m6c3568d1.jpg" />
			<p>
				The data is structured as tree. The Paths from GC Roots
				view shows the first group of paths from GC Roots to the
				object of interest. If more than one path leads from one
				GC Root to the object of interest, the shortest path is
				displayed. This path to sub-objects that are objects
				under the object of interest are not necessarily the
				only references to these objects, therefore you can
				request to display the other path to the object as well.
				To learn more about the paths of a sub object from the
				GC Roots, you have to open the view to the object that
				is of interest.
			</p>

			<strong>Merged Paths to GC Roots</strong>
			<p>
				The Merged Paths to GC Roots view shows the shortest
				paths from the GC roots to each instance of the selected
				class. You can open this heap editor using context menu
				<var class="varname">Merge Shortest Paths to GC Roots</var>
				on any class instance. The heap editor explores all the
				paths at once and is useful to analyze the memory leak
				by finding a common chain of references to a group of
				objects.
