				Memory Analyzer provides several queries to inspect the threads at the 
				moment the snapshot was taken.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Threads Overview</strong></p>

			<p>
				To get an overview of all the threads in the heap dump use the
				<span class="menucascade">
					<span class="uicontrol">Query Browser</span>
					 &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Thread Overview</span>
				</span>
				query:
			</p>

			<img src="../mimes/threads_overview.png" alt="screen shot of thread overview"/>
			<p>
				The query provide some properties like Name, Object, Context Classloader, etc...
				for each of the threads.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Threads Details</strong></p>
			
			<p>
				You can proceed with the analysis of a single thread by using
				<span class="menucascade">
					<span class="uicontrol">Java Basics</span>
					 &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Thread Details</span>
				</span>
				context menu. Memory Analyzer provides an extension point, such that extensions can
				provide semantic information about the threads activity. The result of the Thread Details 
				query will contain such information (if available), some overview information, and 
				possibly the stacktrace of the thread.
			</p>

			
			<p><strong>Threads Stacks</strong></p>
			
			<p>
				Some heap dump formats (e.g. HPROF dumps from recent Java 6 VMs and IBM system dumps)
				contain information about the call stacks of threads, and the Java local objects per 
				stack frame. To access this information for all threads use the query
				<span class="menucascade">
					<span class="uicontrol">Java Basics</span>
					 &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Thread Stacks</span>
				</span>
				with no objects as parameter. To view the call stacks of particular selection of threads use
				the same query from the context menu. 
			</p>

			<img src="../mimes/thread_stack.png" alt="screen shot of thread stack"/>
			<p>
				Exploring the call-stacks and the local Java objects is a powerful feature, giving a
				debugger like capabilities over a snapshot. It allows analyzing in details the reason
				for a memory intensive operations. And it also enables that heap dumps and Memory Analyzer
				are used not only for memory-related problems, but also for a wide range of other problems 
				e.g. unresponsive applications.
