		    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

			<p>
		    Before looking into the capabilities that Memory Analyzer offers in the area of comparison
		    let us make some explanation. Object IDs which are provided in the heap dump formats supported by MAT
		    are just the addresses at which the objects are located. As objects are often moved and 
		    reordered by the JVM during a GC these addressed change. Therefore they cannot be used to compare the objects.
		    This basically means that if one compares two different heap dumps (although from the same process) it is not
		    possible to point to the concrete objects different between the two heap dumps.
		    However, one can still perform comparison on the aggregated results (e.g. the class histogram)
		    and analyze how the amount of object and the memory they take has changed.
			</p>


			<p>
				Memory Analyzer offers the possibility to compare not only the global class histograms of two different
				heap dumps, but an arbitrary number of table-formatted results - for example the 
				retained sets of three different objects. It doesn't matter if the tables which 
				are compared come from one and the same or different heap dumps.
			</p>

			<div class="p">
				This means that one has the possibility to do things like:
				<ul>
				<li>Compare the retained set of a specific package across several heap dumps</li>

				<li>Compare how the retained sets for application objects A1, A2 and A3 (all in the 
				same heap dump) differ from each other</li>

				</ul>
 
			</div>

			<p>				
				Here is a quick description how to compare several retained set tables.
			</p>

				
			<p>
				<strong>1. Move all tables to be compared to the Compare Basket</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				All queries which are executed in Memory Analyzer can be seen in the Navigation History View.
				From this view one can add the results to be compared to the Compare Basket. 
				The Navigation History is still per heap dump, therefore if one wants to compare 
				tables from different heap dumps then they have to be added one by one.
				Multiple tables from one heap dump can be added at a time. 
			</p>

			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>2. Modify the order of the tables</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				Using the tool bar of the Compare Basket one can modify the order in which talbes 
				should be compared, i.e. select which result should be the baseline, which comes second, etc...
			</p>

			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>3. Execute the comparison</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				Once the preferred order is achieved just click the execute button...
			</p>

			<p>

			</p>

			<p>
				... and see the result.
			</p>

			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>4. Customize the displayed result</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				By default the absolute values of all tables will be shown for every compared property,
				e.g. number of objects, shallow size, etc... One can now change between deltas and
				absolute values, as well as select which columns should be compared:

				<img src="../mimes/nn_select_columns.png" alt="Select Columns To Be Compared"/>				
			</p>
