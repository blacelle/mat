				<dd class="dd">Certain DTFJ dumps can contain snapshots from multiple Java Virtual Machines. This can happen with IBM z/OS system dumps.
				By default Memory Analyzer chooses the snapshot from JVM that caused the dump (as reported by DTFJ), or the first snapshot found.
				Memory Analyzer will produce a warning if additional snapshots are found. Another of these snapshots can be selected by using 
				this option, of the form 'i.j.k' where <span class="keyword parmname">i</span> is the index of the address space required, 
				<span class="keyword parmname">j</span> is the index of the process within that address space and <span class="keyword parmname">k</span> is the index of
				the runtime within the process. This ID is shown in a warning message when multiple dumps are found.
				Instead of an index, an address space identifier, process identifier or runtime identifier as shown by the warning
				message can be used instead. An identifier can be omitted.
