	<h1 class="topictitle1">Heap Dump</h1>

	
	
	<div>
		<p>A heap dump is a snapshot of the memory of a Java process at a certain point of time. 
		   There are different formats for persisting this data, and depending on the format it may
		   contain different pieces of information, but in general the snapshot contains information
		   about the java objects and classes in the heap at the moment the snapshot was triggered.
		   Usually a full GC is triggered before the heap dump is written so it contains
		   information about the remaining objects.</p>

		<p>The Memory Analyzer is able to work with HPROF binary heap dumps, 
		   IBM system dumps (after preprocessing them), and IBM portable heap dumps (PHD) 
		   from a variety of platforms.
		</p>
		   

		<p>
			Typical information which can be found in heap dumps (once more - depending on the heap dump type) is:
		</p>

		
		<ul>
			<li>
				All Objects
				<p>Class, fields, primitive values and references</p>

			</li>

			<li>
				All Classes
				<p>Classloader, name, super class, static fields</p>

			</li>

			<li>
				Garbage Collection Roots
				<p>Objects defined to be reachable by the JVM</p>

			</li>

			<li>
				Thread Stacks and Local Variables
				<p>The call-stacks of threads at the moment of the snapshot, and per-frame information about local objects</p>

			</li>
			
		</ul>

		<p>A heap dump does not contain allocation information so it cannot
			resolve questions like who had created the objects and where they
			have been created.</p>
