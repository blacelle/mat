    <div> 
      <p> 
        <strong>Shallow heap</strong>
        is the memory consumed by one object. An object needs 32 or 64 bits (depending 
        on the OS architecture) per reference, 4 bytes per Integer, 8 bytes per 
        Long, etc. The total is then aligned to 8 bytes.</p>

      <p> 
        <strong>Retained set</strong>
        of X is the set of objects which would be removed by GC.collected.</p>

      <p> 
        <strong>Retained heap</strong>
        of X is the sum of shallow sizes of all objects in the retained set of 
        X, i.e. memory kept alive by X.</p>

      <p>Generally speaking, shallow heap of an object is its size in the heap 
        and retained size of the same object is the amount of heap memory that 
        will be freed when the object is garbage collected.</p>

      <p>The retained set for a leading set of objects, such as all objects of 
        a particular class or all objects of all classes loaded by a particular 
        class loader or simply a bunch of arbitrary objects, is the set of objects 
        that is released if all objects of that leading set become unaccessible. 
        The retained set includes these objects as well as all other objects only 
        accessible through these objects. The retained size is the total heap 
        size of all objects contained in the retained set.</p>

      <img src="../mimes/62ff1436.png" />
      <p>The Minimum Retained Size gives a good n estimation of the retained size 
        which is calculated about 1.000 times faster than the exact retained size 
        of a set of objects. It only depends on the number of objects in the inspected 
        set, not the number of objects in the heap dump.</p>
