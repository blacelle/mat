				This tutorial provides a "jumping-off place" to get familiar with
				Memory Analyzer.
			</p>


			<p>
				<strong>Step 1 - Getting a Heap Dump</strong>
			</p>


			<p>
				The Memory Analyzer works with
				<a href="../concepts/heapdump.html">heap dumps</a>
				. Such a heap dump contains information about all Java objects alive
				at a given point in time. All current Java Virtual Machines can
				write heap dumps, but the exact steps depend on vendor, version and
				operation system. Find out more in the section
				<a href="../tasks/acquiringheapdump.html">Acquiring Heap Dumps</a>
				.
			</p>


			<p>
				Open
				<img src="../mimes/me76fc4.png"/>
				<a href="javascript:liveAction(&#34;org.eclipse.mat.ui&#34;,&#34;org.eclipse.mat.ui.snapshot.actions.OpenSampleHeapDumpAction&#34;,&#34;org.eclipse.mat.ui.help/heapdump/HeapDumpSample.hprof&#34;)">
					a sample heap dump</a>
				if you view this page inside the Eclipse help center.
			</p>


			<p>
				For the purpose of this tutorial, we use Java 6 and JConsole on
				Windows. Start your application with Java 6, then start
				<samp class="codeph">&lt;jre6&gt;/bin/jconsole.exe</samp>
				and select the running application (in this case Eclipse):
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorial_jconsole_open.png" alt="JConsole dialog to open a connection to a Virtual Machine."/>

			<p>
				Then, select the operation
				<em>dumpHeap</em>
				from the
				<em>com.sun.management.HotSpotDiagnostic</em>
				MBean. The first parameter
				<em>p0</em>
				is the full path to the heap dump file. Make sure you give it the
				file extension .hprof. The second parameter
				<em>p1</em>
				should be left at true as we are only interested in live objects.
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorial_jconsole_mbean.png" alt="Select the dumpHeap method of the HotspotDiagnostics mbean."/>

			<p>
				<strong>Step 2 - The Overview</strong>
			</p>


			<p>
				Open the heap dump via
				<span class="menucascade">
					<span class="uicontrol">File</span>
					 &gt; <span class="uicontrol">
						<img src="../mimes/i-openhd.png"/>
						Open Heap Dump...
					</span>
				</span>
				to see the overview page.
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorial_overview.png" alt="Memory Analyzer's overview page for a heap dump"/>

			<p>
				On the right, you'll find the size of the dump and the number of
				classes, objects and class loaders.
			</p>

			<p>
				Right below, the pie chart gives an impression on the biggest
				objects in the dump. Move your mouse over a slice to see the details
				of the objects in the object inspector on the left. Click on any
				slice to drill down and follow for example the outgoing references. 
			</p>


			<p>
				<strong>Step 3 - The Histogram</strong>
			</p>


			<p>
				Select the
				<em>histogram</em>
				from the tool bar to list the number of instances per class, the
				<a href="../concepts/shallowretainedheap.html">shallow size</a>
				and the
				<a href="../concepts/shallowretainedheap.html">retained size</a>
				.
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorial_histogram.png" alt="Histogram"/>

			<p>
				The Memory Analyzer displays by default the retained size of
				individual objects. However, the retained size of a set of objects -
				in this case all instances of a particular class - needs to be
				calculated. 
			</p>


			<p>
				To approximate the retained sizes for all rows, pick
				<img src="../mimes/i-calcrs.png"/>
				from the tool bar. Alternatively, select a couple rows and use the
				context menu.
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorial_calc_retained.png" alt="Select calculate retained sizes from the tool bar"/>

			<p>
				Using the
				<strong>context menu</strong>
				, you can drill-down into the set of objects
				which the selected row
				represents. For example, you can list the
				objects with outgoing or
				incoming references. Or group the objects
				by the value of an
				attribute. Or group the collections by their
				size. Or or or...
			</p>


			<p>
				One thing that makes the Memory Analyzer so powerful is the fact
				that one can run any action on any set of objects. Just drill down
				and slice your objects the way you need them.
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorial_context_menu.png" alt="Drill down via the context menu"/>

			<p>
				Another important feature is the facility to
				<strong>group any histogram by class loader or packages</strong>
				.
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorial_group_by.png" alt="Group the histogram by class loader or package via the too bar"/>

			<p>
				Any decent application loads different components by different
				class loaders. The Memory Analyzer attaches a meaningful label to
				the class loader - in the case of OSGi bundles it is the bundle id.
				Therefore it becomes a lot easier to divide the heap dump into
				smaller parts.
			</p>

			
			<p>
				More: <a href="../tasks/analyzingclassloader.html" title="Class loaders load classes into the memory of the JVM. When analyzing the heap, class loaders are very important for two reasons: First, applications typically load components using separate class loaders. Second, the loaded classes are usually stored in a separate space (e.g. the perm space) which can also be depleted.">Analyze Class Loader</a>
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorail_by_classloader.png" alt="Histogram grouped by class loader"/>

			<p>
				Grouping the histogram by packages allows to drill-down along the
				Java package hierarchy.
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorail_by_package.png" alt="Histogram grouped by packages"/>

			<p>
				<strong>Step 4 - The Dominator Tree</strong>
			</p>


			<p>
				The
				<a href="../concepts/dominatortree.html">dominator tree</a>
				displays the biggest objects in the heap dump. The next level of the
				tree lists those objects that would be garbage collected if all
				incoming references to the parent node were removed.
			</p>


			<p>
				The dominator tree is a powerful tool to investigate which objects
				keep which other objects alive. Again, the tree can be grouped by
				class loader (e.g. components) and packages to ease the analysis.
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorial_dominator_tree.png" alt="Dominator Tree"/>

			<p>
				<strong>Step 5 - Path to GC Roots</strong>
			</p>


			<p>
				<a href="../concepts/gcroots.html">Garbage Collections Roots (GC roots)</a>
				are objects that are kept alive by the Virtual Machines itself.
				These include for example the thread objects of the threads
				currently running, objects currently on the call stack and classes
				loaded by the system class loader.
			</p>


			<p>
				The (reverse) reference chain from an object to a GC root - the so
				called path to GC roots - explains why the object cannot be garbage
				collected. The path helps solving the classical memory leak in Java:
				those leaks exist because an object is still referenced even though
				the program logic will not access the object anymore.
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorial_path_menu.png" alt="Select path to GC roots from the context menu"/>

			<p>
				Initially, the GC root reached by the shortest path is selected.
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorial_path.png" alt="Path to GC roots"/>

			<p>
				<strong>Step 6 - The Leak Report</strong>
			</p>


			<p>
				The Memory Analyzer can inspect the heap dump for leak suspects,
				e.g. objects or set of objects which are suspiciously big. 
			</p>


			<img src="basictutorial_run_leak_suspects.png" alt="Run the leak report"/>
