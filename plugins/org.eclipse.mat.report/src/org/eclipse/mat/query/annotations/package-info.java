/**
 * Annotations for Queries.
 * Queries can be annotated with extra information giving the command name, tagging fields
 * as arguments to be filled in, adding help text and menu position.
 * As well as inline annotations, translatable text for the annotation can be placed into an <code>annotations.properties</code>
 * directory for ease of translation.
