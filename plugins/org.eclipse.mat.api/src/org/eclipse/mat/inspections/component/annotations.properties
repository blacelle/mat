ComponentReportQuery.name = Component Report
ComponentReportQuery.category = Leak Identification
ComponentReportQuery.help = Analyze a component for possible memory waste and other inefficiencies.
ComponentReportQuery.objects.help = Set of objects to include in the analysis.
ComponentReportQuery.aggressive.help = Force some analyses to run even if they take a long time. \
Certain heap dump formats such as DTFJ-PHD are very slow to run Collection classes analyses, so for those dumps the \
Empty Collections, Collection Fill Ratios and Map Collision Ratios analyses are omitted unless this option is specified.

TopComponentsReportQuery.category = Leak Identification
TopComponentsReportQuery.help = Creates a component report for every component (class loader) which occupies more memory than the specified threshold.
TopComponentsReportQuery.thresholdPercent.help = Threshold (in percent of the total heap size) which class loaders have to exceed to be included in the analysis
