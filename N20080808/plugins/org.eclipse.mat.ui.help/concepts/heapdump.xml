      <title>Heap Dump</title>
      <conbody>
        <p>HPROF heap dump is a snapshot of java heap at a certain time. A full 
          GC is triggered before the heap dump is written so it contains information 
          about the remaining objects. </p><ul>
        <li>All Objects
        <p>Class, fields, primitive values and references</p></li>
        <li>All Classes
        <p>Classloader, name, super class, static fields</p></li>
        <li>Garbage Collection Roots
        <p>Objects defined to be reachable by the JVM</p></li></ul>
        <p>A heap dump does not contain allocation information so it cannot resolve 
          questions like who had created the objects and where they have been 
          created.</p>
